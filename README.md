# Sample-CDM-Tagger
A simple tool to compare new data to historical records. It will tag rows accordingly as duplicate or NULL. The team of interns I was in designed this tool using PySpark and Jupyter Notebook in Microsoft Fabric as a practice exercise within Lexmark Research and Development Corporation's Digital Transformation program.
